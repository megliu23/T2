//pseudocode:
//import java util package
//create a scanner
//create a random
//create 2 integers
//first integer: how many numbers they are going to be (will be constraints)
//constraints to make sure it is between 5-10 numbers
//second integer: random numbers
//create public static int reverse, reverse first integer
//system.out.print arrays (array.to string(first integer))
//system.out.print arrays (array.to string(second integer))
//reverse second integer
//system.out.print arrays (array.to string(second integer))
//create the reverse method
